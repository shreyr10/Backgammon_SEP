# Backgammon_SEP

A semester-long project divided into several sprints, with the last sprint being the bot development for the game. 

The game is mainly built on JAVA and Swing GUI, with all the necessary animations and functionalities of a proper game.
The movement of a particular checker is based on the move we choose among a list of moves generated on each turn.
